            <p> For the past 2 years the students of the University of Georgia Small Satellite Research Laboratory
                have been designing, building, and testing the Spectral Ocean and Color imager (SPOC) Satellite for NASA.
                SPOC is a shoe boxed size 'cube satellite' with a primary mission of obtaining frequent high fidelity
                multi spectral images of the Georgia coastline in order to monitor estuarine water quality and the health
                of coastal ecosystems. As a condition of funding the mission, NASA requires that the data and images
                obtained by the Small Satellite Research Laboratory be amde available in a processed form to the general
                public and in a raw format to authorized parties. Our team plans to build a website, the SPOC Data Portal,
                with the purpose of disseminating this data, providing updates on the SPOC mission, and facilitating the
                engagement of the local Athens community with reserach done at the University of Georgia.

        <div >
            <p> The lab is an undergraduate led research lab, mentored by faculty, with the goals of launching small, inexpensive satellites into space for gathering scientific data and providing experiential learning opportunities for University of Georgia students. Currently 54 undergraduates from all over campus (geography, physics, engineering, mathematics, computer science, marine science, design, and management) lead and operate the lab. The students strive to enhance science education within and around the UGA community through their scientific endeavors. The lab also is leading the way in developing a Small Satellite Course that will form the foundation of an aerospace-based curriculum at UGA.
