For the past 2 years the students of the University of Georgia Small Satellite Research Laboratory have been designing, building, and testing the Spectral Ocean and Color imager (SPOC) Satellite for NASA. SPOC is a shoe boxed size 'cube satellite' with a primary mission of obtaining frequent high fidelity multi spectral images of the Georgia coastline in order to monitor estuarine water quality and the health of coastal ecosystems. As a condition of funding the mission, NASA requires that the data and images obtained by the Small Satellite Research Laboratory be amde available in a processed form to the general public and in a raw format to authorized parties. Our team plans to build a website, the SPOC Data Portal, with the purpose of disseminating this data, providing updates on the SPOC mission, and facilitating the engagement of the local Athens community with reserach done at the University of Georgia.
